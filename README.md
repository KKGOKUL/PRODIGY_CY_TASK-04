Simple Keylogger

##A basic Python keylogger that records and logs keystrokes to a file. This keylogger captures each key pressed by the user and stores the data in a text file. It is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate how keylogging works and the importance of security against such tools.

- **Key Logging**: Captures all keystrokes, including special keys, and logs them to a file.
- **Stop on Escape**: The keylogger stops logging when the `Esc` key is pressed.

2. The script will start logging keystrokes to a file named `keylog.txt` in the same directory.
